## Tier Guidelines

### Constraint
- Hard rules that must not be violated without explicit discussion
- Examples: tech stack, security requirements, compliance rules
- Usage note should state how to handle violation requests

### Decision
- Choices made with reasoning that could be reconsidered
- Examples: architecture patterns, naming conventions, tool choices
- Must include "When to Revisit" section

### Context
- Background information that informs but doesn't constrain
- Examples: problem history, migration status, domain knowledge
- Should clarify that it's informational, not restrictive
