# Project Instructions

## Knowledge Base

Before starting work, check `docs/knowledge/_index.md` for existing knowledge.

Knowledge is organized into three tiers:
- **Constraints** → follow strictly, do not violate without flagging
- **Decisions** → follow unless there's reason to revisit, suggest changes if context shifted
- **Context** → use to inform your approach, not to constrain

Scan the index, load relevant files, and apply them according to their tier.

When running `/capture-conversation`:
- Classify each item as constraint, decision, or context
- Create files in the appropriate subfolder
- Update `_index.md` with new entries under the correct tier
